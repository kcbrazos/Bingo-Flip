/**
 * The colour key, as a strip to run along the bottom of a stream.
 *
 * Its own browser source rather than a corner of the board's, because it wants the opposite shape
 * from everything else: the board is a square that moves and gets pointed at, and this is a single
 * line that spans the screen and never changes for the whole match. Sharing a source would mean one
 * of them compromising, and the caster losing the ability to hide either on its own.
 *
 * Entirely public - the squares dealt to the room and the set they came from - so like the timer it
 * needs no controller and no credential. Paste the URL and it follows the room.
 *
 * It lists only the colours actually ON this board, not everything the set can produce: a board is
 * a hundred squares out of a couple of hundred, so a fixed key would have a viewer hunting the
 * board for a colour that was never dealt. Comes from the same legendItems() the players' own key
 * uses, so what the stream names a colour and what they see beside their board cannot disagree.
