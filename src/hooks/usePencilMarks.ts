 * Nothing makes one any more. The board now works that deduction out for itself and draws it on
 * every square it holds for, on by default (see lib/deduction), which is a strictly better answer
 * than asking a player to spot the same gaps by hand and click each one - so the gesture went, and
 * with it the wheel-click that Chrome and Firefox both wanted for their autoscroll widget.
 *
 * The kind stays in the type because a player mid-match has crossed squares sitting in localStorage,
 * and they still read back, still draw, and are still cleared by the Clear notes button. Losing an
 * hour of board-reading to a deploy is the thing this hook exists to prevent.

 * way to the one you wanted is exactly the sort of thing that gets a square mis-read.
 *
 * Never sent to the server - they're one player's private deduction, and publishing them would leak
 * exactly the reasoning that wins a match. Persisted to localStorage per room so a refresh mid-match
 * doesn't wipe the board-reading work the player has already done.
 *
 * Square TALLIES used to live here too and no longer do: those are shared with the fleet, so they
 * need a server round trip and their own realtime channel. See useSquareCounts.
