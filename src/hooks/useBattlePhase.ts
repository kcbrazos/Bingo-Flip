 *
 * -- Why this isn't a per-component setInterval any more -------------------------------------------
 *
 * It used to be. Every caller ran its own 1s interval holding its own `now` in its own useState, and
 * the match screen mounts four of them (the room page, the battle phase, the clock, and a stream
 * overlay if one is open). That is four timers for one number - but the timers were never the
 * expensive part. The expensive part was WHERE they lived: the room page's copy sits at the very top
 * of the tree, so a state update in it re-rendered the entire match screen - both 100-cell boards,
 * every marker, the log, the rosters - once per second, forever, for a clock that most of that tree
 * does not draw.
 *
 * -- The split -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Almost nothing needs the seconds. The room page and the battle phase each read exactly one thing
 * out of this - which of STARTING/PREPARATION/MATCH we are in - and that changes twice a match.
 * So `useBattlePhaseName` subscribes to the same tick but hands React a STRING as its snapshot:
 * React compares it, sees "match" === "match", and skips the render entirely. Those two components
 * now re-render on a phase change and on real game events, and not otherwise.
 *
 * `useBattleClock` is the one that still ticks, and it is only ever called by something small that
 * is actually drawing digits.
