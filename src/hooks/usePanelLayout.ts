 * than resetting each time they join a new room.
 *

 * whatever default the caller computes, which is what lets the spectator canvas re-tile itself when
 * a fleet joins or the view switches without discarding the panels the caster did place.
 *
 * localStorage only for now. The profiles.layout column that syncs this across devices via Twitch
 * is a deliberate follow-up: the shape stored here should settle after people have actually dragged
 * panels around, not before.
