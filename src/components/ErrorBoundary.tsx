/**
 * Catches a render error and shows a way out instead of nothing at all.
 *
 * React unmounts the entire tree when a render throws, so without this the page goes completely
 * blank - which is what players saw when a room was deleted or they were kicked out from under a
 * screen that was still reading it. A blank page also hides the cause: the message is printed here
 * and logged, so a report can say what actually broke rather than "it went white".
 *
 * Recovery is a full reload rather than a state reset. Whatever threw did so with data this session
 * is still holding, and re-rendering the same tree would usually throw again.
