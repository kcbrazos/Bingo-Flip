/**
 * Offers to take over hosting when the current host has gone dark.
 *
 * Lives outside the lobby as well as inside it, which is the whole point of it being its own
 * component. The takeover used to be a block inside LobbyPhase, and LobbyPhase only renders at
 * status 'lobby' - so a host who closed their tab MID-MATCH stranded the room completely. Their
 * player row keeps is_host = true, so ensure_room_host (which only fires when nobody at all is
 * host) never promotes a replacement, and the one banner that could have fixed it was on a screen
 * nobody could reach until the match ended. Nothing could end the match. That is a room that stays
 * in 'battle' until someone goes into the database, and there was one.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT gated on the room's status: every phase that has a host button worth pressing -
 * End match, Play again, kick - is a phase where losing the host hurts.
