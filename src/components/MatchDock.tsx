 *
 * Everything here used to be a card in the right-hand column - the key, the room/seed/rejoin box,
 * the overlay link, End match, Leave match. Stacked vertically they took a column roughly as wide
 * as the fleet roster and left most of it empty, which is a lot of screen to spend on things you
 * touch about twice a match. Flattened into a bar they cost one line, and the canvas above gets the
 * width back - which goes mostly to the fire board, the one thing anybody is actually looking at.
 *
 * Full width rather than lined up with the board, so it reads as furniture like the top bar rather
 * than as a caption belonging to one panel.
