/**
 * Room codes out of the Lands Between - "GILDED ERDTREE" instead of "X7SU6B".
 *
 * The word lists were Battleship's nautical ones until the rework, which meant every room anybody
 * ever joined was called SALTY KRAKEN or DROWNED GALLEON. A room code is the single most-repeated
 * string in the product - it is read aloud on stream, typed into chat and pasted into Discord - so
 * it is the last place to leave the previous game's vocabulary lying around.
 *
 * Stored WITHOUT a separator (`SALTYKRAKEN`) on purpose. The alternative, storing the pretty
 * hyphenated form, makes lookup fragile: someone reading a code aloud gets typed back as
 * "salty kraken", "Salty-Kraken" or "saltykraken", and there's no way to re-insert a separator
 * into an unseparated string during a lookup. Storing the bare form means normalizing input is
 * just "uppercase, drop everything that isn't a letter or digit", which all of those collapse
 * to identically. The separator is re-derived for display instead (see formatRoomCode).
 *
 * Old-style random codes keep working untouched: they normalize to themselves and simply fail
 * the word split, so they render as-is.
