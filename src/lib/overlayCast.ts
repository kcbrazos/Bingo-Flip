/**
 * The link between a caster's control page and their OBS browser sources.
 *
 * -- Why a broadcast channel rather than the database ------------------------------------------
 *
 * A bingo board hides nothing, so the caster's browser sources can read the same claim log every
 * player can - there was never a credential to gate. What the sources CANNOT do is drive themselves:
 * a pinned source states its view in the URL, and an unpinned one follows the control page down a
 * Realtime broadcast channel. The channel therefore carries framing only - zoom, centre, opacity,
 * which team to isolate - and nothing that could leak if it went to the wrong place.
 *
 * The trade to know: broadcast is ephemeral. If the control page is closed the sources freeze on
 * the last frame they were sent, which is why HEARTBEAT_MS exists and why the board reports a stale
 * controller rather than pretending. Refreshing a source is safe - it announces itself with `hello`
 * and the controller answers immediately.
