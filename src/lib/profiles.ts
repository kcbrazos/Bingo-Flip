 * dropped - match_fleets, match_events, match_participants - so they could not have worked, and
 * nothing called them.
 *
 * The records page reads its two tables directly in lib/stats.ts, which needs no paging: an archive
 * of finished matches is a few thousand rows at most, well inside PostgREST's single-response cap.
 * If that ever stops being true, the loop is worth recovering from git history - it handled the
 * silent truncation that cap does, which is not obvious to write a second time.
