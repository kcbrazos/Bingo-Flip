/**
 * Checks that RENAMED_SQUARES still describes a rename anyone could act on.
 *
 *   node --experimental-strip-types scripts/check-square-names.ts
 *
 * A square's name IS its identity in `match_events`, so renaming one splits its history unless the
 * old name is folded into the new (see RENAMED_SQUARES). The failure mode is silence: nothing throws,
 * the Almanac just shows one boss twice with half its attempts each, and board balancing measures
 * reachability off matches it can no longer reconcile.
 *
 * This is the half of the guard that needs no database. It cannot know a rename happened - only
 * scripts/audit-square-names.mjs can, by reading what the archive actually holds - but it does catch
 * every way an entry that IS written down can be wrong, which is the common case, since an entry is
 * typed by hand at the moment of the rename and never looked at again.
 *
 * Add it to `npm run check` and a broken map fails on the machine that broke it.

 * The bingo sets author one square as "Kill %demiNum% Unique Demi-Human Bosses" and put "Kill 4 ..."
 * on the board, so the raw name is not what a rename would ever be written against.
 *
 * The dedupe is what makes the duplicate check below mean anything. Scadu League weights a variable
 * by repeating its values - `"hang": ["2","3","3","3"]` is one square that lands on "3" three times
 * as often - so a flat expansion reports a dozen of that set's squares as colliding with themselves.
