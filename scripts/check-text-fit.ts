/**
 * Checks that a square's name is sized to actually FIT its square.
 *
 * The thing this guards against is specific and was live on the board for a long time: a name whose
 * longest word is wider than one line gets that word broken by `overflow-wrap: anywhere`, the break
 * costs a line, and the line-clamp then ends the square in an ellipsis. Every "Dragonbarrow" square
 * did it, at every panel size, because the old fit was estimated from character counts.
 *
 * So this walks the real boss board at a spread of cell shapes and asserts the two things that have
 * to hold for a name to render whole: no word wider than a line, and enough lines for the name to
 * wrap into. It calls textFit's own line breaking rather than a second copy of it, so a bug there
 * can't be agreed with here.
 *
 * Bare Node has no canvas, so fitText measures with its flat-average fallback - this proves the
 * layout ARITHMETIC rather than the font metrics. The metrics are the browser's problem and the
 * browser is exact about them; the arithmetic is ours, and is what broke.
 *
 * Run with bare Node:
 *
 *   node --experimental-strip-types scripts/check-text-fit.ts
